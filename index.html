                    <h1>Student in Data Science and Operational Research (double degree)</h1>

                    <p>I am passionate about mathematics since my youngest age for the numbers, their exactness, their rigor, their logic and their various applications. I have a strong interest Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but also in financial markets and the mathematics used in the field.</p>
                    <p>I always have had a logical mind and I am kind of solving problems and complex challenges. I recently participated to the 2023 Data for good hackathon from JP Morgan and a Hackathon organized by PSL group and the DGFIP.</p>
                    <p>Regarding my hobbies, I am a ping pong player and an aspiring chess player. I like a lot reading books about human behavior, evolution and physics (especially about the Universe), but I also spend a lot of time studying theoritical books of mathematics for finance.</p>
