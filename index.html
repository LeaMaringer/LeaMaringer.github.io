                    <h1>Student in Mathematics and Finance</h1>

                    <p>I have been passionate about mathematics since my yougest age and quickly developed a strong fascination with randomness and an interest in financial markets. During my last academic year, I particularly enjoyed exploring pricing problems and methods. I am also drawn to programming, especially algorithmic approaches.</p>
                    <p>I have always had a logical mind and enjoy solving problems and tackling complex challenges. For instance, I participated in the 2023 and 2024 Data for Good hackathons from JP Morgan, as well as a hackathon organized by the PSL group and the DGFIP in 2023.</p>
                    <p>As for my hobbies, I run and do bodybuilding daily, and I am an aspiring chess player. I like a lot reading books about human behavior, evolution and physics (particularly topics related to the universe), as well as crime fiction and thriller novels.</p>
